title:  Not Feeling Well
---

I am not feeling well. So I am not going to try to write. I'll quote
something random. From _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead_, by Tom
Stoppard,

> PLAYER: We can give you a tumble if that's your taste, and times being what they are... Otherwise, for a jingle of coin we can do you a selection of gory romances, full of fine cadence and corpses, pirated from the Italian; and it doesn't take much to make a jingle-- even a single coin has music to it. _They all flourish and bow, raggedly._ Tragedians, at your command.

I love this play.
