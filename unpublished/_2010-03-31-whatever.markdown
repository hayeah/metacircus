title: Whatever
---

No idea what to say. So whatever.

The other day I was having supper at a restaurant by myself. Since
there was nobody to talk to, I was flipping through a magazine. I saw
an advertisement for a DVD. The movie, I don't remember the title,
involves sorority girls and violent killings (not just killings. it's
gotta be bloody killings). Tacky DVD cover.

But still, the cover has a blurb: "Exhilarating! (\*\*\*\*)" Four
stars! I sat there and tried to imagine somebody whose job is to
write enthusiastic blurbs B horror films. I wonder what that
person is like. I wonder how much money he makes.
