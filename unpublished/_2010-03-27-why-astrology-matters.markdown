# Astrology: Why It Matters

It's amazing how people can pick up some arbitrary system, and then
fit reality to that system. Selective attention is a wonderful
thing. But I wonder what motivates mentioning of astrological signs at
all. Sure, we enjoy gossip. Why not get right to the point? Why is it
we always talk about relationship in astrological terms?

I think it's a rhetorical device. I would appear nosy if I asked you
about your past relationships without any natural pretext. If I don't
know anything about you (or in a group, nobody knows anything about
anybody), then astrology could serve as a neutral entry point into the
more personal stuff.

> "I find Scorpios are always such assholes." <br/>
> "I've not been with a Scorpio, but I find that Geminis really work for me. Geminis are generally blah blah and blah."

So the conversation segues into *Things That Matters*. We are not
really talking about Geminis (or whatever), but the personal
qualities, attached under some lablel. We can be saying bad things
about a friend, but that doesn't count, because we are talking instead
about a label.

Then you might discover that somebody is of a type that you are not
supposed to be compatible with,

> "Oh, she's a Scorpio? She doesn't seem it though." <br/>
> "Ya, she's sweet. But she has her dark side."

Well, so much for compatibility theory. We have no problem making
exceptions. And it's always easy to accept contradictions. She's
sweet, but she has her dark side. Who isn't? We are all full of
contradictions.

On the other hand, there are the Chinese astrological signs. Nobody
ever talks about them. Why not?

* When you are a teenager, the time you start learning about relationship, *everyone* in your class has the same Chinese astrological sign, so there's nothing to talk about.
* When you are older, age becomes a sensitive issue. That I am born on the Year of Rat exposes me. This is especially true for women.

So the Greco-Roman astrological system is perfect. _Everybody has
one_, and it's not sensitive information. There's enough variation in
the system to make things interesting, but it's simple enough that
nobody would get confused. It is intellectually democratic, the ideal
environment for a meme to thrive.

This is not to say that astrology and astronomy have nothing in
common. Like how planets orbit in perpetual motion through empty
space, so do our conversations, taking place in vacuum, circle and
circle to all eternity.
