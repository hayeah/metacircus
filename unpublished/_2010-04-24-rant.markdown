So it's been nearly a month since I forced myself to blog. One thing I
learned is that it's not possible to just sit in front of my computer
and expect words to come out. I need to systematically gather raw
materials during the day, snippets, quotes, conversations, or drifting
thoughts.

I am having my mid-life crisis in my twenties. Is this really what I
want to do? Almost certainly no. And in occasional moments of
weakness, I'd wonder if buying a sportscar wouldn't solve all my
problems. It wouldn't. But it is the thinking of these
thoughts that worries me.

There are problems I am ignoring. I should really get to them.

I don't belong here.
