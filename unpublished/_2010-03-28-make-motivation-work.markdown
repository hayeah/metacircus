# Make Motivation Work

The problem with motivation is that it's just a drive. It isn't very
smart. It excites me, and causes me to want to work towards a
goal. But then, it's up to me to come up with the precise actions and
plans I need to get there.

One thing I noticed is that if I leave motivation to itself, then
nothing really changes. I don't do anything different, except that I
do things I am used to with added intensity. Say I am motivated to
start a business, if I don't lay out a plan for change, I just do what
I've always done, which is to read books.

Reading is my default action. If I want to become healthier, instead
of going for a jog, I would by nature sink into a couch and start to
read all about exercising. It's silly, but that's how it is for
me. Now I see that this is going on (that my motivation only gets me
to read!), I am more careful about it.

Rather than defining a goal in abstract terms (e.g. being healthy),
it's better to set the goal as desired behaviour (e.g. jog for 20
minutes 5 times a week). That way there's no room for the mind to be
creatively lazy: it can't do something that seem like work towards the
goal, but really isn't (e.g. reading about exercising).

Feeling motivated is good and fine, but only the actions that come out
of it matter.
