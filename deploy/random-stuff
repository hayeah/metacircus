As I am writing this, I am in San Francisco. This morning I was sitting outside
the Asian Art Museum (coincidentally, not because I am Asian), observing the
hip, the staid, the respectable, the rebellious, the homeless. Then I thought of
the people I've met along the way, and I felt grateful. Fellow
travellers. Friends. Entrepreneurs. Hackers. Sheep herders. Taxi drivers. Street
vendors. Hostel owners. Dogs. Cats. Strangers that said hi.

_I am not alone._

The world, as it is, seems holy. All I gotta do is to keep my eyes open and
see. As the preacher in Grapes of Wrath says,

> I ain't gonna baptize. I'm gonna work in the fiel's, in the green fiel's, an' I'm gonna be near to folks. I ain't gonna try to teach 'em nothing. I'm gonna try to learn. Gonna learn why the folks walks in the grass, gonna hear 'em talk, gonna hear 'em sing. Gonna listen to kids eatin' mush. Gonna hear husban' an' wife a-poundin' the mattress at night. Gonna eat with 'em an' learn...  Gonna lay in the grass, open an' honest with anybody that'll have me. Gonna cuss an' swear an 'hear the poetry of folks talkin'. All that's holy, all that's what I didn't understan'. All them things is the good things.
