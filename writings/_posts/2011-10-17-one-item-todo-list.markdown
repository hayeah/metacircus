title: The One Item TODO List
tag: thought

I fail at TODO list. Every time I tried I failed in the same way. It would work
at first, and I'd feel good about the initial rush of productivity increase
(real or delusional). Then inevitably the list would get bigger, with stale
items left in it like rotten fruits. Eventually I'd abandon my TODO list.

Maybe you feel the same.

# Daily Action

__Every night before I go to sleep, I decide what I want to do the next
day__. Out of the dozens of things I want/need/anxious to do, I'd pick one. Just
one. The next day I'd focus myself doing it. _Everything else I let go_.

That's it.

You don't need to read a
[National Bestselling Book](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318836563&sr=8-1)
about The System&trade;.

I've found that it helps to:

+ __Rephrase the goal as an action__. Instead of saying "practice Lean Startup methodology", say "A/B test font-size to see if it increases Twitter following conversion rate".
+ __Be specific__. Instead of "write a blog post", set the goal to be "write a 500 words blog post about the one item todo list".
+ __Have a clear ending__. Instead of "learn iPhone programming", say "read 2 chapters from Beginning iPhone Programming".
+ __Be conservative__. It is more important to succeed than to be ambitious. We often overestimate how much we can do in a day, but underestimate what we can accomplish in a year. _If you consistently succeed, you are more likely to stick to it_.
+ __Write the action down__. The physical action of writing it down helps to clarify the action. Your action might be clear in your head, but when you try to write it down you might realize, "oh, it's not specific enough", or "oh, it's not actually actionable".
