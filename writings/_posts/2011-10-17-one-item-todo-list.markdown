title: The One Item TODO List
tag: thought
---

I fail at TODO list. Every time I tried I failed in the same way. It would work
at first, and I'd feel good about the initial rush of productivity increase
(real or delusional). Then inevitably the list would get bigger, with stale
items left in it like rotten fruits. Eventually I'd abandon my TODO list.

Maybe you feel the same.

The key, I think, is to realize how fallible I am. Since my [will power is weak
and limited](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/opinion/02aamodt.htm), I have to
be efficient with its use. I can't afford to use any of it to fight my TODO
list. My productivity system needs to be as simple as possible.

It should be as if it doesn't exist.

# Daily Action

__Every night before I go to sleep, I decide what I want to do the next
day__. Out of the dozens of things I want/need/anxious to do, I'd pick one. Just
one. The next day I'd focus myself doing it. _Everything else I let go_.

That's it.

You don't need to read a
[National Bestselling Book](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318836563&sr=8-1)
about The System&trade;.

I've found that it helps to:

+ __Rephrase the goal as an action__. Instead of saying "practice Lean Startup methodology", say "A/B test font-size to see if it increases Twitter following conversion rate".
+ __Be specific__. Instead of "write a blog post", set the goal to be "write a 500 words blog post about the one item todo list".
+ __Have a clear ending__. Instead of "learn iPhone programming", say "read 2 chapters from Beginning iPhone Programming".
+ __Be conservative__. It is more important to succeed than to be ambitious. We often overestimate how much we can do in a day, but underestimate what we can accomplish in a year. _If you consistently succeed, you are more likely to stick to it_.
+ __Write the action down__. The physical action of writing it down helps to clarify the action. Your action might be clear in your head, but when you try to write it down you might realize, "oh, it's not specific enough", or "oh, it's not actually actionable".

# In The Unlikely Event of Failure...

You will fail. Some days you will fail to finish your action. For days at a
time, you might fail to follow the system. A productivity system needs be
resilient to failure because failure is inevitable.

What do you do if you failed to finish your daily action? Don't panic. Don't feel
guilty. It is easy to recover. You have a few options for the next day:

+ __Set the same todo__. Sometime I'd forget about the daily todo and do something else altogether. That's ok. If I still consider the todo my top priority, I'll do that the next day.
+ __Set a smaller todo__. Maybe I tried to finish it, but failed. I'd make a smaller todo. If I failed to finish a blog post, the next day I might want to "finish the outline for the blog post on topic X".
+ __Reprioritize__. Maybe something else becomes more important, then the next day I'd do that.
+ __Give up__. Maybe again and again I'd fail to finish a todo, and I'd become angry and frustrated. It happens sometimes. In which case, it is better to simply leave it unfinished. Just move on to something else.

# The Anxiety of Focus

There's a strange anxiety when you limit yourself to only one action a day. What
if I finish my TODO too early? What do I do with the rest of the day? _What if I
succeed?_ This is the pscyhological paradox of focus.

Warren Buffet said that most people would be a better investor if they limit
themselves to only 7 trades in their lives. But what if I miss out on a great
investment opportunity in the Albertan oil sands?

Having just one action a day forces me to prioritize. When I finished, maybe
it's better that I do nothing else for the rest of the day.

Read a nice poem or something.
