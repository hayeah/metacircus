title: How I Got My Scar

It was a sunny autumn day. I was sitting under a maple tree reading a book. She was resting her head on my thigh, her eyes closed, showering under the blueness of the sky.

She told my thigh a joke. It laughed so hard, it splitted open in the middle, and light shone out. She was startled. But my thigh kept laughing, and laughing. And the light grew more intense.

My thigh still laughs from time to time when I think of her.

So the scar never really heals.
