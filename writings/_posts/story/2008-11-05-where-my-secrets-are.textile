There are different ways to keep secrets.

When I am secretly in love with a girl, I'd tell all her friends, and
beg them never, not ever, to tell her.

When I am secretly hopeful, I'd go to an open field, and in the middle
of it dig a little hole with my hands. Then I'd whisper into the hole
my secret hope, and carefully cover it with earth, twigs, leaves, and
some tears. So when I am old and dying, I could come back and lean
against the tree that had grown.

For secrets I really want to keep, I try to forget.
