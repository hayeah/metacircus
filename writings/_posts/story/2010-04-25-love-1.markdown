...the son shrieked in horror, when he saw in the mirror what his
mother had done to his body. His mother, out of a lingering devotion
possible only in a dying woman, had sewn her eyes on his back, so he
could see the shy glances young women that would cast his way; and she
planted her nose on top of his head, so he would not easily drown even
if water covered over his mouth and nose; and her ears fused into his
lips, so he might listen more than he speak; and her arms grafted to
his trunk, parallelling his own, so that while his arms, strong as
iron, could cut down enemies on the battle field, at home, her arms
would help him cook and sew. Her legs she threw away, for she trusted
that his own were strong enough to take him where he was fated to
go. And she sewed her cheeks to his chest, so that she could feel his
heartbeats... The mother, who had given life to her son, gave him, at
the end of her life, her own life. After she had sewn herself onto his
body, nearly fainting from her loss of blood, incanted the spell that
granted her son dominion over her body. Relieved that her son would be
well taken care of, she allowed herself to die... The son, ungrateful
son of a bitch, went to see priests of all kinds, witches, doctors,
witch doctors, to rid himself of his mother. Not so much to rid of his
mother, but to become himself again...
