# Nothing To Say Today

I don't remember my dreams anymore, though I know
I still dream at night. What would Freud think?

Today was a beautiful day. I did not do anything
useful tonight. But I cooked, and cleaned up my
apartment. I watched another lecture on Nietzsche,
then I watched _Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky_.

It was a good movie. I wish they had somebody
uglier to play Stravinsky. The man in the movie
was simply too good looking. I don't have any
pre-existing idea of Chanel, but I enjoyed the
version in the film.
