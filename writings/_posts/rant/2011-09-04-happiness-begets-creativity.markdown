title: Happiness Begets Creativity
tag: thought
---

Creativity is not constant. Some days I am happier
than others, and those days ideas overrun me. The
lead weight of self-consciousness is made buoyant
by the lightness of heart. On creative days, I am
not just lighter. I become weightless. I float.

When I am creative, it's not so much that I get
better ideas. Rather, because I feel happier,
everything seems better. When I am happy, I am
more willing to listen to myself, so I get more
ideas. And given more ideas, some of them would be
good.

Don't torture your brain to be creative when you
don't feel good. Just give up trying. It's like
wringing sap out of dry dead wood. Instead, work
harder to be happy. But beware of the fallacy of
wanting to fix your life in some big way. It won't
make you any happier. Instead, pay attention to
the little details in life that matter. The
moments make you happy.
