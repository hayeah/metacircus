title: Nothing to Say
---

It's too late to think of something to say. I am sorry I have to
resort again to saying I don't have anything to say just so I have
something to say. Bear with me. I am building the habit to write, so
it's better to write badly than nothing.

Let me think what I can write better. I have lots of stuff I can write
about, but before bed is simply a lousy time to organize thoughts and
write. Right now I am to tired to think about how to improve my blog.

So that's one thing to change. I will stop writing just before
bed. I'll get it done earlier. Tomorrow I'll write about Donkey.
