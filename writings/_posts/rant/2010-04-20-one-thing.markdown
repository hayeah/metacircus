> _The greatest weight._ What, if some day or night a demon were to steal afer you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: "This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence-- even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and your with it, speck of dust!"
> Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: "You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine." If this thought gained posession of you, it would change you as you are or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, "Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?" would like upon your actions as the greatest weight. Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to _crave nothing more fervently_ than this ultimate confirmation and seal? -- _The Gay Science_, Aphorism 341


It's never too late. Just one thing is enough to make it all
worthwhile.
