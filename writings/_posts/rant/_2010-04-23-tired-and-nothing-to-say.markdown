title: Tired And Nothing To Say
---

Reading great pieces of writing is devastating. How can I ever be that
good? Do I just write, write, write, and write some more? This
probably doesn't count. Just saying whatever's on my mind (as it's
been happening more and more lately: nothing) isn't writing.

I just don't feel like saying anything. I'll leave this at this, as I
am bored myself by myself.
