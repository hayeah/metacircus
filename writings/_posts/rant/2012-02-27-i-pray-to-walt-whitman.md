I wish there's more stability in me. Once I am home, I have to face
myself. Being with people is a rather poor palliative. There's something special
about being in the wild. Neuroticism hangs in a city like a smog. None of that in
the mountains and the sea. They are too big for that.

The drive is exhausting.

I wish I am possessed by something more animal. Something more childish. To
insist on being a certain way because I know of no other ways.
