Poor Shylock.

Greentea said that all my characters are depressed. Nothing good ever
happens to them. All lonely, and never find love.

I thought a bit, to come up with a story with a good ending: A guy has
a beloved. I kill off his beloved arbitrarily. The guy feels sad. He
misses his beloved terribly. He wants her back. He searches for
her. He dreams of her. Eventually, the guy goes crazy, and
hallucinates the girl. He's happy again.

An image of happiness doesn't really come to mind. I can recall
moments of bliss from my life. But happiness seems to imply a
contentedness I've never had. I am always fighting something.

"I am happy" doesn't say much about what the person is happy
about. People can say that "I am happy" in the most incredible
circumstances. Not being able to say "I am happy" almost seems
immoral. Why am I not getting the most out of life? And I am
ungrateful of what I have in life.

A story with a happy ending doesn't really have anything to do with
happiness. Life isn't like that. Prince and princess finally get
married, but the story doesn't end there, and they don't live happily
ever after. They grow old and die. The princess, perhaps, would die of
childbirth. The prince, likely, my be poisoned by a coveting sibling.

I think that a happy ending is satisfying not because we vicariously
experience that bliss. Rather, the craving for a happy ending is a
social instinct. Seeing the author putting the characters through all
sorts of fanciful tortures, our natural empathy is evoked to wish the
pain be lifted. And we sit uncomfortably until the story resolves
favourably for the characters. When the pain lifts for the characters,
the pain lifts for us as well.

It's a vicarious act of virtue. We don't need to do anything, but we
get the same feel-good-ness of having helped someone. Happy endings
are psychologically satisfying.

What that means, then, is that a happy ending cannot exist by
itself. The characters must suffer enough to evoke our empathy, so
they deserve the reward when it comes. Even though no magic would
protect the hero from certain death; the dead heroine would stay
dead; power wins; good things never last; we can't all be happy...

But then, being cynical is the opposite problem of wanting cheap happy
endings. It feels smart to be cynical. Oh, I am no fool, I know how the
government really is!

Reality is never that simple. It's neither entirely good nor entirely
bad. There's no such thing as a happy ending or bad ending. Things end
favorably for some people, and unfavorably for others. Antonio's gain
is Shylock loss. It is only a good ending because the reader is
manipulated to side with Antonio, so the empathy belongs all to
him.

Poor Shylock, persecuted Jew.
