> Bread is the most everyday and familiar of foods, the sturdy staff of life on which hundreds of generations have leaned for sustenance. It also represents a truly remarkable discovery, a lively pole on which the young human imagination may well have vaulted forward in insight and inspiration. For our prehistoric ancestors it would have been a startling sign of the natural world's hidden potential for being transformed, and their own ability to shape natural materials to human desires. --  Harold McGee _On Food And Cooking_

Only a food writer could sing a semi-religious paean to bread. "A
lively pole on which the young human imagination may well have vaulted
forward", really?

But going meta, each profession perhaps is wont to overestimate its
importance to humanity. Fact is, there had been so many turning points
in the history of humanity. Fire. Language. Agriculture.
Bread. Citystate. The Gutenberg press. Sanitation. The Internet. Paris
Hilton.

These "turning points" are not revolutionary. It's not like one day we
don't have the Internet, the next day we do. It took time. An idea
needs to take root in society, and grow into it. It is not the idea
itself, but the society accepting that idea, and reifying an almost
ghostly abstraction to concrete things that affect real lives. Society
is the soil into which ideas are sow.

Turning points are invented after the fact. The hero that brought fire
to humanity was not Prometheus, but the moms that used it to make food.
