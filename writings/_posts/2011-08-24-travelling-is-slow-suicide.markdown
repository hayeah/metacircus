title: Travelling is Slow Suicide
tag: thought
---

Chatting, I said that "选择长期旅行应该算是一种慢性自杀。环境的变化一点一滴地渗
透，而取代了原来的自我".  Choosing long-term tavel is perhaps a kind of slow
suicide. The changes in the environment slowly saturate me, and replace my
original self bit by bit.
 
I was baffled by why people wouldn't do anything to change their lives if they didn't
like it. Why wouldn't they quit their jobs? They have the money, what are they
afraid of? A friend asked me if I thought of that people may not want to travel
like me. Which struck me as true.
 
I remembered how much I hated my life. It was easy for me to give up everything
and go. I have zero regret that I did. It may be true that a person hates his
job, and hates his boss. But there are other things they are not willing to give
up. Often a good life is putting up with things you don't like so you may enjoy
things you do value. Maybe for some people a shit job is a fair trade to be able
to watch TV at home after work. Being content, why would they want to travel?
 
Being unhappy made me desperate for change. So here I am, in Kuala Lumpur. The
sky is very blue, and the food very good.
