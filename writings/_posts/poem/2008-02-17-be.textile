everything has been said
nothing can be said
anything may be said
but my mouth won't say.

i love you. you love me.
my arms was around her.
his arms was around you.
i loved her, you loved him.

the has been could have been,
the done to be undone.
it has been done,
we have yet to be.

it's all new, and old,
and old, but renewed.

everything has been said
nothing can be said
anything may be said
but my mouth won't say.

so it has been,
so we have been,
so.
so.
so.
maybe.

we will be.

then.

we will have been.
