I dreamed of us as a tree, and my limbs growing
into yours, and you swallowing me up with your
embrace. This growth is driven by life, and binds
us by life. And slowly we are dying, by growing
into one.

We worry not where we are going, or where we are,
for the sun comes to us, and the rain sweetens our
life. Our roots anchor us to Earth, that massive
stability. Yet our branches and leaves extend into
the Heavens, light as air, and exuberant, free as
birds.

So we do not fear the wind, as if it breaks your
limb, I too, would feel the pain. Nor the
lightning, for it shall consume us both with
fire. Having grown into each other, enough time,
we will die, and rot. Then the Earth will take us
back, and create more dreams of trees.
