this is a poem i wrote 
for me and

the story of me and
the gazing into the sky
the searching over the horizon
the looking over the shoulder...
me and

happy times
sad times
times unsad
but unhappy times--
it's good to know
it's not about me
but me and

there is no reason
for him and her
or her and him
but i know
i know i know
there is
for me and

a call to me from
a nighty night
a hug, a kiss
a happy birthday
a song, a card
a cup of tea
a secret shared
between me and

i sit, i think of
i think of, i write
of happy times
sad times
times unsad
and unhappy times
times that belong
to me and

a line drawn from me to
a cricle around me and
a thought, a smile
some bitterness
some sweetness
a story, a poem
a song of me

and
