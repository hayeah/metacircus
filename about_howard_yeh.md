In 2011/2012 [I quit my job and
travelled](/writings/2011/09/19/from-the-office-to-travelling-the-world.html). I
travelled in Asia, spending time in Thailand, China, Korea, Cambodia, Malaysia,
and Singapore. Trite, but true, it had been a [transformative
experience](/writings/2011/08/24/travelling-is-slow-suicide.html).

In school I studied cognitive science. As a result, I cogitate excessively. I
like philosophy. Some of my favourite badass philosophers are Nietzsche,
Wittgenstein, and Hume.

I also enjoy reading history. As far as history goes, I'd take good writing over
TRUTH. My favourite storytellers are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=barbara%20tuchman&tag=metacircus-20&index=books&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Barbara Tuchman</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&x=0&ref_=nb_sb_ss_i_0_4&y=0&field-keywords=niall%20ferguson&url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&sprefix=nial&_encoding=UTF8&tag=metacircus-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Niall Ferguson</a>.


I make computer do things. Ruby is my weapon of choice. I have a soft spot for
Lisp. It is my first love. A few things I've made:

+ [Love letter generator](/hacking/2009/04/15/rant-lovely.html)
+ [Bootstrapping Lisp compiler for Erlang](https://github.com/hayeah/serl)
+ [Facebook privacy for Chrome Extension](http://getfaceoff.com)
+ [Quickcheck for Ruby](https://github.com/hayeah/rantly)
+ [Ruby interactive shell](https://github.com/hayeah/rubish)
