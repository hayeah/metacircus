What works.
  my writing is good enough.
  people who takes the time to read it like it
  personal stuff is great. people dig that.
  images are good. personalize it.
  
What doesn't work.
  engagement is not very good
    it's not immediately grabbing. wall of text syndrome
    how do i stand apart from other blogs?
  i am not keeping record of baseline to make incremental improvements
  it's not terribly entertaining, IMO.
  metrics not actionable
    i know that HN doesn't quite work. forget about that.
  my posts are not linkable
  my posts are not relevant. they are just kinda weird and obscure
  my posts are not interesting to a specific community
  no cross-linking when you finish reading an article
  too little presence where people are
    so less chance for them to find me
  traffic from news aggregators are horrible. don't bother building an audience from those.

Action Items
  make it easier for people to find me
  go for community sites
    be helpful to people
    generating
  traffic is MUCH better if people are already looking for something

  Hangout at IRC?
