<h1>Why I Became Wise</h1>
<p>A child was lost in the woods of my consciousness. A place populated<br />
by Wild Machineries and Wondering Beasts.</p>
<p>Wondering Beasts that devoured his simplicity. They hid in the<br />
bushes, hung from the trees, pounced at him from behind, and lept out<br />
from the ground underneath him, to bite into his soul with sharp<br />
questions: “who/what/how/when/why are you?”</p>
<p>And Wild Machineries that grew into his body. Rusty nails hidden among<br />
fallen leaves. Poison arrows coming from no one. Shrapnels shooting<br />
out from imaginary bombs. Words. Razors. Bitter memories. These<br />
objects, inert parasites, would cut into him and become alive at the<br />
taste of blood. Once embedded in his body, they blossomed into<br />
constellation of gears and wheels.</p>
<p>These machineries grew larger than the child’s tiny body. Antlers that<br />
extended into the heavens, making it difficult to balance his head.<br />
Wings that spanned 10 feet, anchoring him on earth. His teeth<br />
sharpened into fangs of empty rhetorics. His nails lengthened into<br />
claws that grasped for existence…</p>
<p>More and more these outgrowths slowed him down, ane less and less of<br />
his simplicity– his bouyant lightness– remained, devoured by the<br />
Wondering Beasts.</p>
<p>One day the weight of the Machineries became too much to bear. So the<br />
child sat on a rock and became a philosopher, his lightness no longer<br />
enough to float him into the air.</p>
<p>To this day, he still sits on the same rock.</p>
<p>Maybe one day the rock he’s sitting on would vanish under him.</p>
