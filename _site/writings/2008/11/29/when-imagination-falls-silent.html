<h1>When Imagination Falls Silent</h1>
<p>A ventriloquist was hopelessly in love with his wooden dummy. His<br />
wooden dummy was in love with him. At least that’s what he told me.</p>
<p>“But a dummy is a dummy! It doesn’t speak! It is you that speaks!” I<br />
tried to reason with his absurdity. He looked at me with some pity, as<br />
though he couldn’t comprehend my naïveté, and said, “no one in the<br />
world knows her better than me.” And to prove it, he kissed her on the<br />
whorls of her cheeks. “See how she’s blushing,” he said triumphantly.</p>
<p>I didn’t see her blushing.</p>
<p>And the dummy knew everything about the ventriloquist. At least,<br />
that’s what she told me (it really did seem that she spoke). When I<br />
asked the ventriloquist what inspires him, he said one word, “Sweets.”</p>
<p>Before I could ask him to elaborate, the dummy spoke. He likes<br />
cheesecake. He always has mango cheesecake. And it’s not the cake, but<br />
the tea he drinks with it. He wouldn’t admit that it’s bitterness,<br />
rather than sweetness, that inspires him.</p>
<p>As I was scribbling down what she said in my notebook, the<br />
ventriloquist gave me a knowing wink. I still don’t know what he meant<br />
by that.</p>
<p>A few years later, I went to see the ventriloquist again. He called in<br />
the middle of a performance, telling me that he was in trouble, and<br />
had no one to turn to.</p>
<p>“She stopped speaking to me!” he shook me by my shoulders when I<br />
entered his backstage room. He had the dummy put behind a veil. He<br />
said he couldn’t bear her indifference any longer.</p>
<p>“What happened?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Ohhh, the things I didn’t say. The things I wouldn’t say.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you should try speaking to her?” I suggested, feeling a bit<br />
self conscious saying the obvious.</p>
<p>“No!” he glared at me, “you don’t understand. She wouldn’t speak to<br />
me! She wouldn’t speak to me!!”</p>
<p>Then he broke down crying.</p>
<p>He did not finish his performance that night. The next day, he was<br />
dead, and his dummy sold at an auction.</p>
