<h1>How You See The Fullness of My Being</h1>
<p>I led her by her hands into the garden I have become. I had no idea<br />
why she wanted to see it– I knew the garden by heart, and there was<br />
nothing beautiful in it.</p>
<p>First, I took her to a flower patch near the edge of the garden. An<br />
ill tended patch of nameless, withering flowers. I thought she’d lose<br />
interest, so we can quickly get out of the garden. But she looked at<br />
it, and said, quietly, “it’s beautiful”.</p>
<p>“Right…” I rolled my eyes, and looked at the sorry flower patch with<br />
some contempt. To my surprise, I saw it exploding with colours! Pink<br />
roses, red roses, white poppies, red tulips, marigolds, and magolias<br />
of splendid beauty. I didn’t know all these flowers grew together.</p>
<p>“Show me more,” she said.</p>
<p>So I took her a little deeper into the garden. We stopped in front of<br />
two giant trees. One was upside down, its roots extended into the sky,<br />
extracting nourishment from whatever little moisture there was in the<br />
air, and its foliage buried deep into the ground, depriving itself of<br />
light. The other was missing half its trunk, so its floating foliage<br />
shriveled because its roots couldn’t provide any nourishment for its<br />
thriving.</p>
<p>“Sorry, these trees are a bit… awkward,” I apologized, with a bit<br />
awkwardness, “I might have planted one of the seedlings upside down.<br />
And I forgot to water them for some years when they grew.” She looked<br />
at the trees, and found herself puzzled. “They look perfectly normal<br />
to me,” she said. I looked at the trees again, and sure enough, they<br />
were upright, complete, and bursting with health.</p>
<p>“Show me more,” she said.</p>
<p>My head was spinning a little. “Are you sure?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Show me more,” she said.</p>
<p>So we walked together, deeper into the garden. We came before an abyss<br />
we had to cross. Only a rickety bridge spanned over the yawning<br />
darkness. “Please, <span class="caps">PLEASE</span> do not look down into the darkness,” I<br />
begged her before we crossed the bridge. I held her hand, and she<br />
chose to close her eyes, as I led her over the abyss, so she saw<br />
nothing of its darkness– all she felt was the moistness in my hand,<br />
its trembling, and its warmth.</p>
<p>So she opened her eyes again, and smiled at me. I saw the grass on<br />
both sides of the abyss grew and grew, covering over its bottomless<br />
depth.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep going,” I said.</p>
<p>So we passed by a tree bearing glowing orange fruits. She asked me<br />
what they were. I told her that the tree feeds on my hopes. The fruit<br />
tastes like sunshine, but the seeds are incredibly bitter. She stood<br />
on her tiptoe and strained for a fruit. She picked the biggest she<br />
could reach. I took over the fruit, splitted it open, and tried to<br />
remove its seeds the best I could. But the seeds were tiny and<br />
transparent, so I missed a few.</p>
<p>When the fruit touched her lips, I’d swear that it glowed a little<br />
brighter. It was probably my imagination playing tricks on my mind.<br />
She said she didn’t taste any bitterness. The seeds, she said, tasted<br />
like almonds. That’s impossible, because the seeds, as I said, are<br />
incredibly bitter. It must have been her imagination playing tricks on<br />
her mind.</p>
<p>We sat under that tree for a long time. When we were rested and ready<br />
to leave, the rotting fruits on the ground came alive, and imbued the<br />
air with a drunken aroma full of life.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep going,” I said.</p>
<p>So I decided to take her to the place where I define myself. To get<br />
there, we must pass through a narrow passage that had clocks growing<br />
on the cliff walls.</p>
<p>Even at some distance from the entrance, I could hear the cacophony of<br />
grandfather clocks chiming, cuckoo clocks chirpping, digital clocks<br />
beeping, analog clocks ticking. Each clock marked a different time.<br />
There was one that counted down to the time of my death, one that<br />
chimed each time I ate a grape, another that ticked with my heart, yet<br />
another to my sense of her breathing, and so on.</p>
<p>I hated going through the passage. I never could make sense of<br />
anything with the thousands of clocks drowning out my thoughts in<br />
total noise.</p>
<p>I entered the passage with some reluctance. But the moment we stepped<br />
across the threshold, the clocks, thousands of clocks, swung in synch<br />
in an instant, tick-tick-ticking in perfect rhythm. And as we went<br />
deeper and deeper into the passage, the ticking became slower and<br />
slower. At the end of the passage, in front of a cave, it stopped.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep going,” I said.</p>
<p>So we were surrounded by complete silence in the cave, except the<br />
echoes of our footsteps and breathing. What I wanted to show her, was<br />
a shrub about waist high. Each of its leaves a mirror that reflected<br />
myself in a different perspective, and with a different distortion. I<br />
often went into the cave to examine its leaves, and each time, I’d<br />
find new pieces of my complete self.</p>
<p>I brought her to where the shrub was, and lit the torches I had around<br />
it, so that the shurb was engulfed within the flames of its self<br />
reflected light. This was so she could see the fullness of my being.<br />
She looked into the shrub and gasped,</p>
<p>“This is me! More beautiful than I had ever known!”</p>
