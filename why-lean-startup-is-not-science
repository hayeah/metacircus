# why lean startup isn't science

What is science?
Science is the art of finding things out.
Asking why

Startup is about seeking what works. It is adaptation.

Science has epistemological basis.

Lesson: Don't follow dogma.

When I do an experiment, I am not seeking to explain. Scientist ask why?
ENtrepreneurs ask how & what.
