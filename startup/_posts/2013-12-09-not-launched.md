Every week, I am going to write about the biggest problem I am having in my effort to build a startup. If that means that every week I am going to write about the same thing, then so be it.

The biggest problem I have this week is that __I don't have a product launched__.

# Why Not?

You might ask a lonely person, "why not just go out and make some friends?" Similarly, it seems like such a simple problem for me to solve.

+ Just launch it.
+ Real artists ship.
+ Done is better than perfect.
+ Fail fast...

And so on.

# What is an MVP

I was very excited about Lean Startup methodology when I first learned about it. But one thing about Lean Startup movement really bothers me, and it's how lazy it allows people to be. You are expected to validate your startup idea [in a weekend](http://startupweekend.org/), or else you are wasting time and energy.

To be fair, Lean Startup asks you to be cheap, not lazy. However, many people, struck by a brilliant idea at a cocktail party, would only go so far as to putting up a landing page. If nobody signed up... well that was that. Back to the office tomorrow.

It's hard for [good ideas](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html) to come by. If I think I might have a good idea, why should I give up so easily after only a simple "MVP"? I had got to do more than a landing page.

What I liked better was Paul Graham's idea of creating a "quantum of utility", which is something that is useful enough to get some people to start talking to you.

So I started coding.

# Look Ma, No Launchable Product, and it's cool

What I wanted to build at first was "CodeSchool as a service". It provides an in-browser programming environment for technical book authors or open source communities to build interactive tutorials.

Since I am building it for geeks, I thought I could iterate based on

1. what I wanted for myself, and
2. what my friends would tell me they want.

I spent about a week playing with [Docker](http://docker.io), [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and the [ACE Editor](http://ace.c9.io), to get familiar with what they are capable of, and see how I might use them in my project. It was a happy time.

Then I spent about 10 days putting together a quick tech demo that barely worked, and showed it to my friends. Some thought it was really cool. Some asked how it could make money. Some thought meh, real programmers should learn programming with Emacs.

This demo really wasn't meant to be launched. I just wanted to make sure that I could get it to work.

## Still No Launchable Product...

I was going to attend RubyConf China in October. I thought my goal was to get tech bloggers, speakers, and podcasters interested in the tool, and to create content with it. Since I positioned it as an authoring tool at the time, I didn't think it was necessary to launch a public demo. I just wanted the content creators.

I focused on designing a template language that's easy to use, and streamlining the creative process by providing little conveniences like [LiveReload](http://livereload.com).

Sadly, when I was at the conference, I wasn't very good at getting people to sit down with me and forcing them to see what I was building. Despite that, I *did* talked to a few key people who were interested, which justified my staying focused on building the tool.

So... another month went by, and

### STILL No Launchable Product

Officially. Not. Funny. Anymore.

I've been going at this for 3 months now. It'd be funny if it's not so scary on a personal level. How long could I go without launching anything? It's not that I haven't DONE anything. It's just that I haven't accomplished anything either.

One of the reasons I am starting to blog again is to tell the world: HEY! I've been working, I haven't been lying around getting fat! Although I might as well have been lying around.

# Ok. Let's Fix This

I am omitting a great many detours along the way. Frustratingly, it seems as though I am no further along the way than when I started 3 months ago.

Sad face :'(

But if I could walk away with a few lessons, I could still call it a win...

1. The hardest thing in the world is getting people interested. **Try way harder.**
2. Don't overly rely on any single individual to help you.
3. Friends don't count as users.
4. If you can't have strangers to see you work, you don't have a prototype.
5. If you are not launched, you haven't got started.

So dear strangers, please allow me to **try way harder**.

P.S.

I open-sourced the authoring tool at [Fork2 Builder](https://github.com/hayeah/fork2-builder).
