title: There's A Way
---

Yesterday I attended my first IDEO Human Centered Design workshop in Chengdu, China. The cynical part of me rolled its eyes multiple times as I worked the exercises. But I suppressed that feeling and got on with it anyway. I think it was wonderful.

The unbridled optimism of the "methodology" seemed American, if not Californian. I think it's got something fundamentally right. When you are trying to be creative, you've got to be open to everything. First let all the options surface so you don't get tunnel-visioned (which I am now), then weed things out.

A lot of the feeling of being stuck is the logical mind telling me that X gotta happen before Y, and X doesn't happen, no matter how hard I try. Then I just feel like fuck there's no way out of this.

Of course there's a way.
