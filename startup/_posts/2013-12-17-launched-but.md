title: Launched, But...

So [last week](http://metacircus.com/startup/2013/12/09/not-launched.html) my biggest problem was "not launching". [It's launched](http://fork2.com:3000), on port 3000, lolz.

It looks like a web version of an e-book... which it is.

You might ask, what's the point? There are tools (like Sphinx) out there doing this already, why bother?

I'll be the first to admit that it's not there yet. But let's just assume that for coding, you can significantly improve upon the learning experience over e-books. What are some ways?

+ Social. Connect with peers. Teaching assistant. Q & A.
+ Interactive content. Make it easy to follow along code examples.
+ Mobile. On-the-go experience (include coding).

Right now you don't have any of that if you choose to learn from a book.

This version is the beginning of my third product pivot. It's embarrassing that this is all I have, but I am slowly getting a better understanding of the product I want to build, and how the product vision aligns with the long-term vision I am after.

I am not a product person at all, so "product design" had been a terrible pain, and slow. Given that I don't have product-design super power, the single most dangerous thing for me to do is to keep doing this groping-in-the-dark methodology of design.

I often imagine a miniature Paul Graham hovering over my right shoulder whispering imperatives. And now he's asking me to,

## Biggest Problem This Week

"Getting users" is too vague a goal for me to pursuit directly. Perhaps "Growth Hackers" have levers to pull to do that. I don't.

It's easier for me to think about delivering value.

The biggest problem this week is... *drum roll*

## Not Delivering Value

The problem has two aspects to it,

1. What group of people?
2. What to give them?

I plan to provide introductory content for one emerging programming language that has an active developers community. One of [Clojure](http://clojure.org), [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org), or [Julia](http://julialang.org).

P.S.

The authoring tool is open-sourced at [https://github.com/hayeah/fork2-builder](https://github.com/hayeah/fork2-builder). Watch the development there :)
