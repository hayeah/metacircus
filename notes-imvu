Is "science" really a good analogy for lean startup methodology? Maybe it is
more about evolutionary adapatation. Science "explains" things. What's the
epistemological source of lean startup? What does it explain?

- what do you do when it's so hard to find data? too few visits to hit
  statistical significance. Can't be "rapid". How do you get started?

300k

- i have a personal blog. It's so hard to experiment. The basis is too small.
-- what do you do to find that initial basis? how to find the niche to get started?

I guess it's really about Optimizing for fitness. So often ideas exist in a
vacuum.

start with use cases. what does your customer want? then you come up with ideas
how to satisfy that, then things to test.

you need an intuition.

don't ask what customers want. ask what they are trying to do.

- IMVU had a non-evolutionary jump in their UI. How do you do that making
  incremental experiments?

- i guess the fundamental problem is if you don't have something good to begin
  with, it's hard to improve from there.

- how the heck is it science? how often are we like, hmm, this converts 30% better, wtf?

** measure how happy and productive people are. IMVU use subjective & qualitative interviews.
 - this is apparently very important. and I believe it.

do postmoterms and retrospectives
 need a skilled facilitator that pull information out from the team

- now they only ask "are we doing the right things for the customers". why did they decide to stop measuring points flow (or whatever)

- does "why 5" always work? he acknowledges as much that it almost always turns out to be "people problem". but this sort of deep digging might well turn any problem into something universal.
 -- in any case, maybe i can think about how to try that

- they had interrupt team to fix broken tests.

** talk to customers all the time. do interview. talk to them in person. survey. forum. twitter. blogpost

** focuse on features and values to customers, not time.
 - it's not enough to do it. you gotta do it right. otherwise why bother even doing it.


having somebody just going around "caring" for people, makes a big difference. happiness => productivity

** focus value on customers

- it's kinda interesting that listening to what he's doing is quite different from theory. they keep changing and changing.

- do you ever go back to old approach? placebo effect. if you change something, you get immediately productivity lift that last a couple weeks (see peopleware).
-- it seems to help to always stir things up a bit so you don't course along. keeps you on the edge. be a little uncomfortable.
